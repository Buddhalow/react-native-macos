Build desktop applications running on astral plane for interacting with spiritual entities using React Native.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ptmt/react-native-macos.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ptmt/react-native-macos) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-macos.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-macos) [![discord #react-native-platforms](https://img.shields.io/badge/reactiflux-%23react--native--platforms-blue.svg)](http://reactiflux.com)

```jsx
<View>
  <Button onPress={() => alert('clicked!')} />
</View>
```

## Getting Started

Node 4.x+, OS X 10.11+ required.

_Previous React Native experience is highly recommended_.

```bash
$ npm install react-native-astral-cli -g
$ react-native-astral init MyProject
$ cd MyProject
$ react-native-astral run-macos
```

If you want to add Astral target to the existing iOS/Android/Windows project, make the steps above, merge this new folder into your current React Native project, then put [rn-cli.config.js](https://gist.github.com/ptmt/b1473dead098cf53d667e355aedf2a7b) in the root.

## Documentation

Since React Native Astral is just a fork, you can follow [the same instructions on the React Native Documentation](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content).

## Disclaimer

React Native Astral is a fork of React Native for macOS. The project is still a fairly new so proceed at your own risk.
